- Tool calling and integration
- Memory and persistence
- Parallel execution
- Error handling and recovery

## 3. Advanced Patterns
- Agents in LangGraph
- Multi-agent workflows
- Human-in-the-loop (HITL)
- Streaming responses
- Long-running tasks (async/background jobs)

## 4. Ecosystem & Deployment
- Vector database integrations (Pinecone, Weaviate, FAISS, etc.)
- External API integrations
- Scaling and concurrency
- Persistence and checkpoints
- Deployment (FastAPI, serverless, Docker)

## 5. Practice/Use Cases
